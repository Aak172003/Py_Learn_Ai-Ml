Composite transformer are of 3 types

1. Column Transformer :

Column transformer is a kind of transformer , which is most suitable for heterogeneous data
means we have single datasets with different different datasets
so with column transformer we can able to apply different different transforms on different different columns
After horizontally concatenate we get more number of columns


2. Feature Union :

Apply multiple Transformation
But these transformations apply to parallel
Apply on entire datasets

3. Pipeline :

Apply multiple Transformation
But these transformations apply on sequentially (Output of previous transformation becomes input for the next transformer)
Apply on entire datasets
